% Short summary of the context, the problem, your approach and its experimental results.
% 2 sentences about scope and problem
Intelligent vehicles that autonomously plan, communicate, and perform intersection crossings will reduce accidents and delays compared to human drivers.
Previously proposed solutions require the use of additional expensive infrastructure, such as centralized Intersection Managers.

In this paper, we propose a decentralized intersection management that requires no additional infrastructure and can tolerate timing deviations due to unpredictable but detectable events, such as pedestrian movement or ambulances. 
Vehicles cooperate via direct VANET communication to agree on a schedule that specifies the groups and the order in which approaching vehicles will cross the intersection. 

% State your results in numbers
Our simulations show that CISCAV ensures safety and keeps the average delay in high traffic conditions at $\SI{32}{s}$, while conventional crossing policies, such as traffic lights, increase the delay up to $\SI{150}{s}$.
